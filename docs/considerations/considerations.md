### logging in a Microservices Architecture
#### Consistency:
Ensure that all microservices use consistent log levels and log format. This makes it easier to analyze logs when they're consolidated.

#### Centralized Logging
Due to the distributed nature of microservices, implementing a centralized logging solution like ELK Stack, Graylog, or AWS CloudWatch Logs is almost a necessity.

#### Request Tracing
Implementing a correlation ID for each request can help in tracing how requests travel through different microservices. This is particularly useful for debugging and performance optimization.

#### Environment-Specific Levels
The log level might need to be dynamically adjusted based on the environment (e.g., Debug for development, Info for production).

#### Rate Limiting and Log Rotation
Microservices can generate large volumes of logs. Implementing rate limiting and log rotation strategies can help manage the storage of logs efficiently.

#### Sensitive Information
Make sure that no sensitive information is being logged, especially at lower log levels.

#### Automated Monitoring and Alerts
For higher log levels like Error and Fatal, automated monitoring and alerting should be set up to notify the team of issues that need immediate attention.

### Identify and resolve bottlenecks

- Identify and resolve bottlenecks such as single points of failure in our design:
    - What if one of our services crashes?
    - How will we distribute our traffic between our components?
    - How can we reduce the load on our database?
    - How to improve the availability of our cache?
    - How can we make our notification system more robust?
    - How can we reduce media storage costs?

### Resilient
- Running multiple instances of each of our services.
- Introducing [load balancers]() between clients, servers, databases, and cache servers.
- Using multiple read replicas for databases.
- Multiple instances and replicas for our distributed cache.
- Exactly once delivery and message ordering is challenging in a distributed system, we can use a dedicated [Message broker]() such as [Apache Kafka]() or [NATS]() to make our notification system more robust.
- We can add media processing and compression capabilities to the media service to compress large files which will save a lot of storage space and reduce cost.
