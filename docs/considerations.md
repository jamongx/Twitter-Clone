### Design and Decoupling

- Domain-Driven Design: Organize your microservices around business domains to ensure each service is cohesive and aligned with business functionality.
- Loose Coupling: Services should be as independent as possible, with well-defined interfaces and protocols for communication.
    

### Data Management

- Database per Service: Each microservice should have its own database to ensure loose coupling and to prevent data schema changes in one service affecting others.
- Data Consistency: Implement strategies for maintaining data consistency across services, such as eventual consistency or transactional outbox patterns.


### Communication

- Synchronous vs Asynchronous: Decide on the communication mechanisms between services. REST, gRPC, and GraphQL are popular for synchronous communication, while message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka are often used for asynchronous communication.
- API Gateway: Consider using an API Gateway to route requests and aggregate responses, which simplifies client-side interactions and may offer additional features like rate-limiting and caching.


### Scalability and Performance

- Horizontal Scaling: Design your services to be stateless so that they can easily scale horizontally to handle increased load.
- Load Balancing: Employ load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a service.


### Deployment and Orchestration

- Containerization: Use container platforms like Docker for packaging services and their dependencies.
- Orchestration: Use an orchestrator like Kubernetes to manage containers, handle scaling, and ensure high availability.


### Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized Logging: With multiple services, centralized logging becomes critical for debugging and monitoring.
- Observability: Implement metrics collection, tracing, and monitoring to understand the behavior of your services.
- Health Checks: Implement health check endpoints to monitor the status of each service.


### Security

- Authentication and Authorization: Consider how you'll secure your services. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth are popular choices.
- Data Encryption: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Network Isolation: Use firewalls, VPCs, or other means to isolate services and limit their exposure to the internet.


### Reliability and Resilience

- Circuit Breakers: Use circuit breakers to handle failed requests gracefully.
- Retry Logic: Implement retry mechanisms to handle temporary network failures.
- Rate Limiting: Protect your services from being overwhelmed by too many requests.


### Documentation and Governance

- API Documentation: Keep up-to-date documentation to explain how services interact.
- Versioning: Use API versioning to handle changes without affecting existing clients.
- Service Discovery: Utilize service discovery mechanisms to allow services to find each other dynamically.
- Configuration Management: Externalize configuration details and manage them centrally.

### logging in a Microservices Architecture
#### Consistency:
Ensure that all microservices use consistent log levels and log format. This makes it easier to analyze logs when they're consolidated.

#### Centralized Logging
Due to the distributed nature of microservices, implementing a centralized logging solution like ELK Stack, Graylog, or AWS CloudWatch Logs is almost a necessity.

#### Request Tracing
Implementing a correlation ID for each request can help in tracing how requests travel through different microservices. This is particularly useful for debugging and performance optimization.

#### Environment-Specific Levels
The log level might need to be dynamically adjusted based on the environment (e.g., Debug for development, Info for production).

#### Rate Limiting and Log Rotation
Microservices can generate large volumes of logs. Implementing rate limiting and log rotation strategies can help manage the storage of logs efficiently.

#### Sensitive Information
Make sure that no sensitive information is being logged, especially at lower log levels.

#### Automated Monitoring and Alerts
For higher log levels like Error and Fatal, automated monitoring and alerting should be set up to notify the team of issues that need immediate attention.

### Identify and resolve bottlenecks

- Identify and resolve bottlenecks such as single points of failure in our design:
    - What if one of our services crashes?
    - How will we distribute our traffic between our components?
    - How can we reduce the load on our database?
    - How to improve the availability of our cache?
    - How can we make our notification system more robust?
    - How can we reduce media storage costs?

### Resilient
- Running multiple instances of each of our services.
- Introducing [load balancers]() between clients, servers, databases, and cache servers.
- Using multiple read replicas for databases.
- Multiple instances and replicas for our distributed cache.
- Exactly once delivery and message ordering is challenging in a distributed system, we can use a dedicated [Message broker]() such as [Apache Kafka]() or [NATS]() to make our notification system more robust.
- We can add media processing and compression capabilities to the media service to compress large files which will save a lot of storage space and reduce cost.
