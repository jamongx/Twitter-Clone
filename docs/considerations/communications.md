- Synchronous vs Asynchronous: Decide on the communication mechanisms between services. REST, gRPC, and GraphQL are popular for synchronous communication, while message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka are often used for asynchronous communication.
- API Gateway: Consider using an API Gateway to route requests and aggregate responses, which simplifies client-side interactions and may offer additional features like rate-limiting and caching.
