- Create a Git repository where I'll store my code. This could be on GitHub, GitLab, or any other Git-based SCM.
- Establish the project folders and directory structure

### Explanation of the Structure:

#### README.md
- Documentation about the project, how to set it up, and other necessary instructions.


#### docker-compose.yml
- A file to define and run all your Docker containers locally for development.


#### kubernetes/
- This folder contains all Kubernetes configuration files required to deploy the services on a Kubernetes cluster.


#### gateway-service/
- This is the API gateway that routes external client requests to the appropriate microservices.
- Dockerfile: To build a Docker image for the service.
- package.json: File containing metadata and dependencies for Node.js.
- src/: Source code directory.
- tests/: Unit and integration tests.


#### user-service/
- Service responsible for managing user data and user-related operations.
- Similar structure to the `gateway-service`.


#### tweet-service/
- Service responsible for tweet operations like posting a tweet, deleting a tweet, etc.
- Similar structure to the `gateway-service`.


#### timeline-service/
- Service responsible for generating timelines for users.
- Similar structure to the `gateway-service`.


Each service folder contains a Dockerfile to build its Docker image and usually has its own database, represented here implicitly. This separation allows each service to be independently developed, tested, deployed, and scaled.

This is just a simplified example; you could add more services or divide existing services further depending on the project requirements.
