- Identify and resolve bottlenecks such as single points of failure in our design:

- What if one of our services crashes?
- How will we distribute our traffic between our components?
- How can we reduce the load on our database?
- How to improve the availability of our cache?
- How can we make our notification system more robust?
- How can we reduce media storage costs?
